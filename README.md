Our project can be opened with Anaconda's JupyterLab or with the jupyter notebook
command in your terminal.

The libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib,and scipy were imported.

The data is found in the folder named datasets and the analysis was done in the Jupyter Notebooks project.ipynb, analysis.ipynb, and Echo_s.pynb.

Notes:
The find.peaks may cause bugs, please change the distance to some other value, excute it, and then change back to the original value.
//change the distance here when it says something out of range: peaks, _ = find_peaks(filtered_signal, distance=100)
